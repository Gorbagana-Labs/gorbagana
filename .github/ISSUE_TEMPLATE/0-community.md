#### Problem
<!--
  The GitHub issue tracker exists to track issues
  that affect the development of Gorbagana itself.

  If you need technical support using Gorbagana, building
  an app, or running a validator, don't open an issue here.

  Instead, post your question to the Gorbagana Stack Exchange:
  https://gorbagana.stackexchange.com/questions/ask
-->
<!-- If reporting a crash, degraded performance, etc, please include the software version(s) you are using. -->

#### Proposed Solution
